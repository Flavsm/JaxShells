# Jax Shells

## Overview

E-commerce website to sell sea shells. Users are able to choose sizes, variety packs, check prices and add it all to the cart. The cart can be seen and updated as the user adds or removes items.

## Purpose

This project started as a way to practice and apply Javascript to real apps.

## Challenges

The challenges of this project were mainly:

* Using only vanilla JS and CSS to make the cart animations
* Updating the cart with new/deleted items while increasing or decreasing the total
* Using previously unkown features of CSS

## Implement

Future features I would like to implement are:

* More noticeable notification system as the user adds/deletes items to the cart
* Add a payment page just to showcase that feature
